							<b>AI and Safety Challenges to Deploying Autonomous Vehicles at Scale</b>
							<br> In this talk, we will discuss the unique challenges for AI and safety posed by the emergence of autonomous vehicles. Almost every aspect of this technology, from the stakes, to the complexity, to the business opportunity, to the potential for societal impact, combines to make it one of the biggest challenges for building safe AI systems that we as a society have faced to date. I will discuss some of the key challenges, such as moving fast while staying safe, safely using deep learning, and building redundant, robust AI. Additionally, I will provide some insight into how we at Lyftâ€™s Level 5 engineering team have begun thinking about these challenges.

								<b>Adversarial Robustness for AI Safety</b>
								<br> Many deep learning models today are vulnerable to adversarial examples, or inputs that have been intentionally optimized to cause misclassification. In the context of computer vision, object recognition classifiers incorrectly recognize images that have been modified with small, often imperceptible perturbations. In this talk, I will first discuss some important topics in AI Safety, and then motivate why it's important to develop models robust to adversarial perturbations. Then, I will give an overview of the adversarial example literature and go over the concepts behind previously proposed attacks and defenses. Finally, I will discuss adversarial logit pairing, the current state of the art defense on ImageNet.

							<b> Integrity and Confidentiality for Machine Learning</b>
							<br> Training and inference of machine learning models is often outsourced to a centralized cloud service, which raises fundamental questions of trust and confidentiality. On the one hand, the user(s) have no guarantees that the cloud provider won't tamper with the training/inference algorithm, e.g., to reduce its work load or intentionally return maliciously crafted responses. On the other hand, the provider observes all the users' data, a serious privacy breach in settings where this data is of a sensitive nature (e.g., medical records).
							<br>
							In this lecture, we will explore various techniques from cryptography, security, and statistics to ensure integrity and confidentiality when applying machine learning to user-provided data. Specific topics include computing on encrypted data, zero-knowledge proofs, trusted hardware, differential privacy, and others.

								<b>â€‹Ethics, Public Policy, and Autonomous Vehicles</b>
								<br>
							In this session we will explore the ability of market incentives and government regulations to both encourage and discourage ethical business practices. We will also explore several ethical and strategic issues related to development of autonomous vehicles. The session introduces cost-benefit analysis and analyzes the role of social institutions in aligning profit incentives and social welfare.  We will also discuss moral intuitions that people have about companiesâ€™ safety decisions.  Specific questions to be covered includeâ€‹:â€‹
							<br><li>Who should make decisions about programming â€‹and design â€‹(e.g., the degree to which a car prioritizes the safety of its passengers over the safety of other people)?   The government?   Individual companies?  Individual consumers?</li>
							<li>To what extent do different companies (e.g., GM, Google, Mobileye, Tesla, Uber) have shared interests inâ€‹ regulatory policy for autonomous vehicles?  To what extent do they have divergent interests?</li>

								<b>Learning Rewards for Deep RL</b>
								<br>
								In domains with easily measurable objectives, deep reinforcement learning has the potential to turn larger and larger computing budgets into smarter and smarter behavior. This possibility was recently illustrated by AlphaZero's impressive performance.
								<br>
								Unfortunately, many of the tasks we care about don't have simple short-term objectives: making good policy, predicting long-term consequences, deciding what news to read, resolving disagreements, clarifying our preferencesâ€¦ Progress in deep RL could make us extremely good at optimizing simple short-term objectives like profit or user engagement, without corresponding improvements in our ability to figure out what we actually want and how to get it.
								<br>
								This talk will cover techniques for applying deep RL to problems with no simple objective. We'll discuss methods for efficiently doing RL with expensive reward functions (like detailed human evaluations), as well as techniques for using AI to improve on human evaluations and more faithfully capture our preferences.

								<b>Verification of Learning-Enabled, Cyber-Physical Systems</b>
								<br> Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are used in many mission critical applications, such as automobiles, aircraft, and medical devices; therefore, it is vital to ensure that these systems behave correctly. Designs for modern CPSs often include learning-enabled (LE) components, such as neural networks and support vector machines, whose behaviors emerge as a result of processing training data; however, verifying correct behavior of LE aspects of CPS designs is difficult, as the training data and resulting system behaviors can be hard to characterize. To address these challenges, new analysis techniques are needed to increase confidence in the reliability of LE CPSs. This talk describes ongoing challenges in verification for LE CPSs and presents two new approaches to address these challenges. One approach is based on falsification, which uses best-effort methods to automatically identify system behaviors that fail to satisfy requirements. A second approach provides a formal proof of correctness for the system by learning candidate safety certificates from simulation traces, which are then confirmed using automated reasoning tools. The new techniques are presented in the context of autonomous driving application examples.

							<b> The Near Impossibility of Regulating Artificial General Intelligence Development (and How to Change That) </b>
							<br>
							Although society may have compelling reasons to seek some regulation of the development of artificial general intelligence, implementing a sensible regulatory framework is likely to be enormously difficult.  My premise here is that acknowledging and trying to understand such difficulty is an indispensable part of any credible effort to address the challenges.  I expect to discuss the importance of implementing a standard strategically â€“â€“ with multiple audiences in mind, and with an eye towards embedding certain aspects of the standard in widely used technology.  Iâ€™ll also consider what it might take to build sufficient capacity for detection of AGI research activity, the imposition of credible sanctions where necessary, and the institutional foundations of effective AGI development regulation.

							<b> Towards Verified Artificial Intelligence </b>
							<br>
							The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly of systems that learn from data and experience, is rapidly expanding in our society. Verified artificial intelligence (AI) is the goal of designing AI-based systems that have strong, verified assurances of correctness with respect to mathematically-specified requirements. In this talk, I will consider Verified AI from a formal methods perspective. I will describe five challenges for achieving Verified AI, and five corresponding principles for addressing these challenges. I will illustrate these challenges and principles with examples and sample results from the domain of intelligent cyber-physical systems, with a particular focus on autonomous vehicles.
